# BIG-DATA-AND-DATA-MINING
Task Completion Statement: Big Data and Data Mining Project

I am pleased to confirm the successful completion of the Big Data and Data Mining project, which constitutes 70% of the total marks for the module. This project involved the analysis of maternal health data with the aim of identifying evidence-based actions to improve health outcomes for pregnant women and new mothers.

Project Overview:

Submitted the project via Turnitin on Canvas by the specified deadline of May 12th, 14:00 BST.
Ensured that the written part of the assignment adhered to the maximum word count of 2000 words.
Structured the report according to the provided guidelines, including sections for introduction, analysis, predictions, and recommendations.
Key Tasks and Achievements:

Linear Model Building (6 Marks):

Built and fitted a linear model with explanatory variables chosen based on their relevance to predicting Systolic BP.
Provided explanations for the selection of exploratory variables, demonstrating understanding and rationale.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (12 Marks):

Applied PCA to reduce the number of variables in the dataset, facilitating more efficient analysis.
Presented findings and insights derived from PCA to aid in data interpretation.
Age and Heart Rate Relationship (20 Marks):

Investigated the relationship between age and heart rate through age grouping, accompanied by graphical representations.
Justified the choice of age intervals based on logical considerations and calculated mean heart rates for each group.
Association Analysis of Blood Pressure (20 Marks):

Described methods for investigating associations between different blood pressure categories.
Calculated and interpreted support, confidence, conviction, and lift for pairs of blood pressure categories.
Clustering Analysis (20 Marks):

Identified clusters of patients with similar Systolic BP, providing insights into potential subgroups within the dataset.
Correlation Analysis (12 Marks):

Calculated the correlation between age and Systolic BP, offering interpretations of the relationship.
Supported findings with relevant literature and discussed implications for maternal health practices.
Grading Criteria:

Ensured that Python code was uploaded alongside the written submission, demonstrating competency in coding and data analysis.
Provided comprehensive analyses, models, and interpretations, supported by evidence derived from the dataset.
Utilized appropriate methods and visualizations to enhance the quality of the analysis and interpretation.
I am confident that the completion of this project has not only met the assessment requirements but has also contributed valuable insights into maternal health data analysis. The recommendations outlined in the report have the potential to inform evidence-based interventions aimed at improving maternal health outcomes, thus fulfilling the objectives of the project.
